## üìä What is TechTool Pro?  

**TechTool Pro** is a powerful suite of utilities for macOS focused on system health, drive maintenance, and proactive diagnostics.  
It offers a broad set of tools to test RAM, CPU, GPU, batteries, and connected peripherals, giving users clear feedback about hardware status before failures occur. For storage, TechTool Pro provides advanced disk checking, surface scan, and repair options that go beyond the basic disk utility ‚Äî it can locate bad sectors, verify drive integrity, and attempt repairs or recommend safe cloning when problems are detected.

The app also includes intelligent drive maintenance features such as SMART monitoring, volume sleuthing, and optimization routines to help extend the life of HDDs and SSDs. For data protection and recovery workflows, TechTool Pro lets users clone drives, create images of failing volumes, and run targeted rebuilds of directory structures to help recover inaccessible files. These functions are presented with guided workflows for less technical users, while advanced users can run deep diagnostics and generate detailed reports for IT troubleshooting.

Beyond hardware and disk tools, TechTool Pro supplies performance and cleanup utilities: system checkups, optimization of startup items, and tools for examining system logs and kernel extensions.

- Drive cloning and imaging for safe recovery workflows.  
- System checkups, maintenance, and optimization tools.
